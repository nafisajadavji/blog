## Welcome to Anti-bullying Initiative

Academic bullying is a workplace bullying which takes place at universities and research institutes. This includes social and professional isolation, public humiliation, control and manipulation of information, emotional abuse, abusive working conditions, professional discredit and denigration, intimidation, and the devaluation of professional achievements. Due to the highly hierarchical and competitive nature of the academic and scientific environments bullying is common and relatively rarely reported. The power imbalance and dependency on the supervisorâ€™s actions make junior researchers, postdocs, PhD students as well as technicians particularly vulnerable and very often victims are left without any other options or support. The lack of procedures in reporting and punishing bullies, as well as convenience for such behaviour, cannot be tolerated. Our goals are to increase the visibility of the problem, to create universal strategies of how to recognize and reduce bullying, as well as share strategies with victims on how to overcome this challenge during their career.
